Adamina is a typeface designed for text setting in small sizes. For this purpose the x-height is increased and contrast lowered. Proportions are transitional and compact. Refined design features like one-sided flaring and asymmetrical serifs
are there to provide a pleasant reading experience.

Designed by Alexei Vanyashin for Cyreal.
