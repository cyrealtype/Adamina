# Adamina 

Open-source font

Adamina is a typeface designed for text setting in small sizes. For this purpose the x-height is increased and contrast lowered. Proportions are transitional and compact. Refined design features like one-sided flaring and asymmetrical serifs
are there to provide a pleasant reading experience.

Designed by Alexei Vanyashin for Cyreal.

Adamina is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and 
could be expanded to support other scripts.
